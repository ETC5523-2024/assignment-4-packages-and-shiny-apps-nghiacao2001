## Overview

This package is ideal for sports analysts, data enthusiasts, and fans interested in in-depth EPL analysis for the 2021-2022 season. There are two clean datasets for full league tabler result and halftime result, also there is a plot indicating which teams gain most benefits if games ended halftime. You can open the shiny app dashboard to explore those datasets.
