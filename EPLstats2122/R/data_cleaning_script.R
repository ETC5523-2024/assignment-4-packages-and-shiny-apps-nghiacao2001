#' Full Season Statistics for Soccer Teams
#'
#' This function calculates full season statistics for a specified team based on home and away games. The stats include matches played, wins, draws, losses, goals for, goals against, goal difference, and total points.
#'
#' @param x A data frame containing soccer match data. It should have columns for `HomeTeam`, `AwayTeam`, and the result column, e.g., `FTR` (Full-Time Result) or `HTR` (Half-Time Result).
#' @param teamName A character string indicating the name of the team for which stats are calculated.
#' @param resultColumn A symbol representing the column name that indicates the match result (e.g., `FTR` or `HTR`). Defaults to `FTR` for full-time results.
#' @param resultPrefix A symbol representing the prefix for goal columns (`FT` for full-time, `HT` for half-time). The function expects goal columns to be named with this prefix followed by `HG` (Home Goals) or `AG` (Away Goals).
#'
#' @return A data frame containing the full season statistics for the specified team, including:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \code{Team}: The name of the team.
#'   \item \code{MP}: Matches played.
#'   \item \code{W}: Wins.
#'   \item \code{D}: Draws.
#'   \item \code{L}: Losses.
#'   \item \code{GF}: Goals For.
#'   \item \code{GA}: Goals Against.
#'   \item \code{GD}: Goal Difference (GF - GA).
#'   \item \code{Points}: Total points (3 for each win and 1 for each draw).
