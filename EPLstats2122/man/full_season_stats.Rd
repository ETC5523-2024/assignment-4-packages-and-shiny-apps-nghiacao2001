\title{Full Season Statistics for Soccer Teams}
\usage{
full_season_stats(x, teamName, resultColumn = FTR, resultPrefix = FT)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame containing soccer match data. It should have columns for \code{HomeTeam}, \code{AwayTeam}, and the result column, e.g., \code{FTR} (Full-Time Result) or \code{HTR} (Half-Time Result).}

\item{teamName}{A character string indicating the name of the team for which stats are calculated.}

\item{resultColumn}{A symbol representing the column name that indicates the match result (e.g., \code{FTR} or \code{HTR}). Defaults to \code{FTR} for full-time results.}

\item{resultPrefix}{A symbol representing the prefix for goal columns (\code{FT} for full-time, \code{HT} for half-time). The function expects goal columns to be named with this prefix followed by \code{HG} (Home Goals) or \code{AG} (Away Goals).}
}

\itemize{
\item \code{Team}: The name of the team.
